                    depositsToDelete.add(deposit);
                } else if (withdrawalAmount.compareTo(depositAmount) < 0) {
                    deposit.setAmount(depositAmount.subtract(withdrawalAmount));
                    setBalance(getBalance().subtract(deposit.getAmount()));
                    withdrawalAmount = BigDecimal.valueOf(0);
